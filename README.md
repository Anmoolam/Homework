# Homework Repository

Homework assignments are released here weekly on Sundays. The submission deadline is the next Sunday midnight. Please email the professor with a Github link of your work. For group work, please only email one link per group. Your contributions to the group work will be evaluated via the commit and PR history.

Prerequisite.md contains all installation and tooling instructions for this class. It is useful to refer back to it when there are tooling issues.

Lastly, please don't hesitate to ask for help or post reminders on the Discord! If you are a student and answering a colleague's question, **please do not paste homework answers directly in Discord**. Work on a policy of explaining the concept behind the solution, not the solution itself.
