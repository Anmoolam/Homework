# Homework 3

In this Homework, we will focus on moving towards collaboration on Github. To simplify the process, we will only work on 1 file. You will be graded mainly on the quality of your research paper, but a brief examination of your commit histories, comments, PRs, will also be made.

Since we are simulating a collaboration, here are your groups:

**Group 1: Cédric, Yichen, Laetitia**

**Group 2: Yanming, Aizhan, Valentin**

**Group 3: Margot, Léa, Jiawei**

### Advanced AMM models and Markdown files

Write a 750 word paper on an AMM model which combines oracles and traditional models and evaluate a protocol using this model. Some examples:

* [Sigmadex](https://sigmadex.org/) uses Dynamic AMMs (dAMM)
* [DODODex](https://dodoex.github.io/docs/docs/pmm/) uses Proactive AMMs (pAMM)
* [Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.com/) uses Virtual AMMs (vAMM)

These models are rather new and the protocols adopting these models are most likely young. You may include some extrapolations from older protocols if you cannot find sufficient data on [DefiLama](https://defillama.com/) or other DEX trackers on your chosen protocol.

Sections for your paper:

1. Introduce the protocol, their product offering and make an evaluation of their company (Community and Financial metrics)
2. Introduce the AMM mechanic (general explanation, and intuition, then deeper mathematical explanation)
3. Describe a few use cases where this AMM model is useful or optionally, if you have the expertise, some suitable trading strategies
4. Conclude with some thoughts on your experience of collaborating on Github (what works well, challenges, learnings)

Write this in the format of a Markdown (.md) file. Github is able to directly render Markdown, as you can see from the homeworks. There are also IDE tools which can render markdown on your local machine. You may need to search online to learn the Markdown format, or you can look at the raw format of the homeworks to get an idea.

### Collaborating on Github

In order to learn how to collaborate on Github an dresolved merge conflicts, try to do as much of the writing and discussion on Github as possible. Every team has a different collaboration flows but here are some helpful methods.

##### Git Branch
##### Git Diff
##### Git Merge
##### Advanced Concepts: Revert and Cherrypicking
